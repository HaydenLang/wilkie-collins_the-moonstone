			<h2><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span></h2>
			<p>I address these lines⁠—written in India⁠—to my relatives in England.</p>
			<p>My object is to explain the motive which has induced me to refuse the right hand of friendship to my cousin, John Herncastle. The reserve which I have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted by members of my family whose good opinion I cannot consent to forfeit. I request them to suspend their decision until they have read my narrative. And I declare, on my word of honour, that what I am now about to write is, strictly and literally, the truth.</p>
			<p>The private difference between my cousin and me took its rise in a great public event in which we were both concerned⁠—the storming of Seringapatam, under General Baird, on the 4th of May, 1799.</p>
			<p>In order that the circumstances may be clearly understood, I must revert for a moment to the period before the assault, and to the stories current in our camp of the treasure in jewels and gold stored up in the Palace of Seringapatam.</p>
